Q8 ~ 12. Well written codes. They are readable and neat. I can easliy follow the codes. No other inspections are needed.
Q13. The outputs look good and codes look fine, too. It is good to have detailed explanation of the codes with doctstings but there are some codes I can't easily understand unless I visit the links or watch videos. It would be better to explain them briefly in your own words. 
Q14. I like how you solved the problems by using the concept of recusion. Great job!
