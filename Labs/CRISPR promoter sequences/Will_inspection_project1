Instead of 'take in' and 'produce' in docstrings use 'input' and 'output', and include the respective datatypes

In Motif mehtod, you can used probablility *= instead of probablility = probablilty * 

could use count based profile instead of probablity based profile since you don't calcualte realative entorpy very often
